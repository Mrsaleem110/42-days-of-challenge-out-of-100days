// *Question 125:* Modify a method in an object to use the this keyword to access another property in the same object.
// *Explain & TIP:* You can leverage the this keyword to interact with multiple properties within the same object, providing a cohesive way to manipulate internal data.
// An object with multiple properties and a method that interacts with them using 'this'
var rectangle = {
    length: 4,
    width: 5,
    calculateArea: function () {
        return this.length * this.width; // 'this' accesses 'length' and 'width' properties of the object
    },
};
console.log(rectangle.calculateArea());
